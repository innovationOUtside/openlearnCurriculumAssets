# Introduction

This guide provides a quick demonstration of how we can build a simple curriculum asset bank that supports discoverability and reuse of "micro-assets" including glossary items, learning outcomes, activities, self-assessment questions and media assets..

The asset bank is generated by mining the structured OU-XML documents that are distributed alongside many OpenLearn Units and from which OpenLearn HTML documents are rendered.
