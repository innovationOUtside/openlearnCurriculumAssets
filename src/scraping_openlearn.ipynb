It also demonstrates how we can populate the database with copies of the OU-XML documents associated with those units and trivially query those documents as parsed XML documents using XPATH expressions. Examples are also given of how we can download and inspect zipped HTML bundles associated with free OpenLearn units, extract \"contentful\" image files into a database, and then retrieve and preview those images."

    "In this section, we have seen how we can scrape a list of free OpenLearn units from a catalogue web page on the OpenLearn website and add this data to a simple, file-based database that supported full-text search over the OpenLearn unit name and OU module code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw how we could generate conventional URL paths that allowed us to download the OU-XML files associated with free OpenLearn units and add those to a database table. The XML can then be retrieved from the database and represented as an XML object that can be queried using XPATH expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we demonstrated how we can download an HTML bundle associated with an OpenLearn unit as a zip archive file and programmatically inspect its contents. From the assumed \"contentful\" HTML files in the archive we could identify assumed \"contentful\" images, extract them from the archive file, preview them, store them in a simple file based database, retrieve them from the database and preview them again."
