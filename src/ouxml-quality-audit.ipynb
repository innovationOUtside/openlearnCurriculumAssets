    "# OU-XML Health Checks and Quality Audits\n",
    "\n",
    "As a structured document, OU-XML contains a wide variety of elements that are *countable*. As such, it is trivial to generate reports that describe how many elements of a particular kind are contained within a particular document. For example, we might count the number of learning outcomes defined in a particular unit, or the number media assets it includes. These counts can feed into quality checks for the document. For example, we might require that the number of outcomes is non-zero (i.e. at least one learning outcome is described at a particular level within the OU-XML document); or where media items are included, we might flag this unit as one that may have rights clearance considerations, or that may raise accessibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, several structural elements are defined in such a way that they encourage, if not actually require, the inclusion of metadata or supplementary information. For example, an estimated time requirement in an activity, or a transcript or long description for a media item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the OU-XML document may include references to assets that are themselves \"testable\": web links to third party resources that can be link checked, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will review several ways in which we can produce quick summary reports that review the structural content of an OU-XML document and hint at possible health checks and quality audit data we might derive from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as running reports on individual OU-XML documents, we can also run reports over a set of OU-XML documents, or assets retrieved from them. This means we could generate reports on the health of the OpenLeaen OU-XML corpus *as a whole*, for example. Or audit OU-XML documents from different faculties to see whether units from one facultry have a different asset mix to units from another, for example."

    "De-referencing the relative links may require knowledge of the local context, in which *in situ* testing of materials derived from the source document may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing of absolute links can be performed at any time, and can be tested to check not just that the referenced location can be resolved correctly and returns some sort of resource (for example, the page *does not* return `HTTP 404 not found` or `HTTP 451 Unavailable for Legal Reasons` error; `HTTP 403 Forbidden` errors might also be worth detecting in the context that they identify an authentication context or requirement associated with retrieving the  referenced resource). If requests return an `HTTP 301 Moved Permanently` response, there might be a case for updating the URL. Similarly, other ways of detecting redirects might be used to flag up concerns regarding the current status of link and whether it should be update to point to a resource more directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as simply testing that links resolve, the presence of links in an OU-XML document also raises concerns regarding whether or not the returned resource is the intended resource. Web pages are not ncessarily static and may be update at any time by their owners. Or if a resource disappears and an alternative needs to be found, it may not be clear from the context of the OU-XML document linking to the resource what the resource contained or what was particulalry notable about that resource; this in turn can lead to difficulties when it comets to identifying what an appropriate replacement resource might be."

    "The [`innovationOUtside/ouxml-link-checker`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/ouxml-link-checker) addresses several issues associated with link quality checking, in particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *checking link resolution*:\n",
    "  - broken links (404);\n",
    "  - temporary and permanent redirects;\n",
    "  - links using OU authentication (e.g. *libezproxy* linked domains suffixed by `.libezproxy.open.ac.uk` will have the *libezproxy* component stripped);\n",
    "  - links using liblinks (of the form `https://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/resource/website:ID&f=FID;` the `f=FID` seems redundant - what does it do?)\n",
    "- *link archiving*: for each link to an public web resource, submit the link to the Intenet Archive for archiving purposes. Ideally, OU-XML links to public web resources should have a reference to an archived copy of the referenced resource that can be \"swapped in\" in the case of the original resource disappearing. (This approprach is used for maintaining link stability and integrity in Wikipedia, for example.)\n",
    "- *capturing linked page screenshots*: in many cases, simply being able to see a screenshot of a complete web page will provide enough information regarding the content of the page to be able to identify enough context to support the discovery of a replacement resource. A simple gallery of screenshots of pages referenced from an OU-XML document can also be used to support a quick review of linked to content in an off-line way, as well as automated testing to identify whether the content of a page or a partciular area of the page has changed either at all, or in a significant way. (This may be important for accessibility testing, for example, where the accessibility of linked to resources needs to be checked.)"
