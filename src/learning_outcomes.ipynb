    "# Working With Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes can be created at various levels of abstraction: for example, at the unit level, at the block level, at the module level and at the qualification level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes are distinguished elements in OU-XML documents, although not all materials make use of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can search over learning outcomes specifically in order to discover teaching materials that presumably claim to deliver those outcomes specifically. We can also browse over or search on previously defined learning outcomes to provide inspiration or model phrases for creating new learning outcomes. (Using extracted structure data such as a learning outcomes as training data for machine learning systems is another possibility, although such applications are out of scope of this review.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*You can try such a search [here](https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FinnovationOUtside%2FopenlearnCurriculumAssets%2Fmain%2Fsrc%2Fall_openlean_xml.db%3Fraw%3Dtrue#/all_openlean_xml/lo?_search=describe+problems&_filter_column=&_filter_op=exact&_filter_value=&_sort=rowid). __WARNING: 100MB+ download:__ this database application runs purely in your browser and may take a minute or two to load.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will see how to extract learning outcomes from the OU-XML associated with a single OpenLearn unit, and then create a simple database table that allows us to search over the learning outcomes for all the OpenLearn units that represent them in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning outcomes themselves will be stored in a separate database to database containing the original OU-XML material to try to keep the database sizes down so that we can store them in GitHub and also load them in to browser based query UIs in an efficient way. "
