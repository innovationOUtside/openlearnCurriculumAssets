    "# Querying the Database With `datasette`\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary intention of this set of notes was to explore the disaggregation of OpenLearn OU-XML elements into component parts that can then be searched at an appropriate level of granularity. The intention was *not* to create an end user tool, such as a simple search interface with a single, simple search box and a set of faceted views over the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a demonstration of how the search tables can be searched is provided in the form of an in-browser `datasette` user interface that supports simple full-text search over full-text search indexed tables, as well as finer grained SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "No apology is given for providing such a \"technical\" search interface. User-interface design is a completely separate issue. The database as it stands is __usable today__ by anyone who cares to learn how to use it. It can be used to help identify the sorts of search that a user is likely to want to run, the level of granularity of results that are useful, and the form in which the discovered content should be returned. In contrast, a concept design for a user interface that may never get built, and with no database or search engine behind it, has zero utility for search and discovery, no matter how pretty it is."

    "`Datasette` provides a relatively simple, browser based graphical user interface for querying one or more file based SQLite databases. `Datasette` can run purely in the browser, with no requirements for external hosting or serving of the database. The `datasette` user interface supports the querying of a SQLite database via SQL commands; thise commands may be graphically constructed from ueser interface elements. In addition, if `datasette` identifies the presence of a full-text search table associated with a selected database table, it will present a full text search query box for quering over that table.\n",
